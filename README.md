## General info
Far far away in another galaxy I have seen that someone have created something like this. I wanted too. Why not?

## Install
1. Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/cooligus/Snake3D.git`
2. Get into directory
`cd Snake3D`
3. Run cmake
`cmake -S . -B build`
4. Now you should see couple of errors that CMake have not found some libraries (I have not compiled it successfully so I wish you luck). My pro tip for you is: just install Arch btw (I don't have installed one at the moment).
